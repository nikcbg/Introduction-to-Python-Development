HTTP Request Methods

• GET – Requests a representation of a specific resource. This type of request should only receive data.
• HEAD – Like a GET request, but only receiving the headers (no response body)
• POST – Submits data to the application, usually causing a change in the application’s state
• PUT – Replaces the current representation of the target resource
• DELETE – Deletes the specified resource
• PATCH – Partially modifies a resource

Application Architecture

• Model – It holds onto the data and business logic. Ideally, the model holds onto “the brains” of our application.
• View – This is the representation of our business logic. For our application, the view portion will be the HTML
templates that we render and return.
• Controller – This is the input/output interface for the application. The controller receives requests, then
utilizes the model and view to display the proper response. In Flask, there are a few different ways to create a
“controller,” but in its simplest form the controller will actually be the Flask application itself.
