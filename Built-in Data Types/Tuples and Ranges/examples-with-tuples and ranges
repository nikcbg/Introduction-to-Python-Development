### Tuples are a fixed width, immutable sequence type.

point_3d = point + (4.0,)
point_3d
(2.0, 3.0, 4.0)

 x, y, z = point_3d
 x
2.0
y
3.0
z
4.0

print("My name is: %s %s" % ("Keith", "Thompson"))


### Ranges are an immutable sequence type that defines a start, a stop, and a step value and then the values within are calculated as it is iteracted with

my_range = range(10)
my_range
range(0, 10)
list(my_range)
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
list(range(1, 14, 2))
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
