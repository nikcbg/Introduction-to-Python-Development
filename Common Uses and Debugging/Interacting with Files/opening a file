'read' method to access the underlying data in the file
'write' method to place data into the underlying file

file - The path to the file on disk (or where you'd like it to create it)
mode - How you would like to interact with the file

The file argument is pretty simple, but the mode argument has a variety of options that all work a little differently:

'r' - Opens the file for reading, which is the default mode
'w' - Opens the file for writing, while removing the existing content (truncating the file)
'x' - Opens the file to create it, failing if the file already exists
'a' - Opens the file for writing without truncating, appending any new writes to the end of the file
'b' - Opens the file in binary mode, in which the file expects to write and return bytes objects
't' - Opens the file in text mode, the default mode, where the object expects to write and return strings
'+' - Opens the file for reading and writing
